# emergentPredictability
MATLAB code to reproduce figures in Moran &amp; Tikhonov (2024), "Emergent predictability in microbial ecosystems"

Code by Jacob Moran and Mikhail Tikhonov

To use, run RunMe with no argument. The code will generate all data-dependent figures in the paper.

The precomputed data files (includeed) will be used, if available. Remove (or rename) a data file to recompute it from scratch.

Code uses "parfor" and will use the parallel computing toolbox with the default local configuration, if available.
